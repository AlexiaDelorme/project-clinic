<h1> Veterinary Clinic of Tourrettes </h1>

My project gives visibility to a prospective Veterinary Clinic for my sister who is a Doctor in Veterinary Medecine. <br>

It provides information on the services provided by this "hypothetical" clinic, the location, information about the studies and experiences about the Doctor and functionalities to contact the clinic either by a contact form (that can be used by pharmaceutical companies for instance), a request form (for clients wanting to book an appointment) or directly by phone and/or emails.<br>

The website has both English and French versions as there are a lot of English people established in the South of France and tourists during the summer time. <br>

This website was developed as a prototype that could be directly used the day my sister launches her Veterinary Practice, which is a goal that she has in the medium term. That is why it already has all the features of an existing clinic.

<h2>UX</h2>
The purpose of this website is to provide visibility to the clinic in an area where the location is key. <br><br>
The layout of the website is very simple but classy, the content is purposely kept very minimalist (so that the user is not drawn into a myriad of paragraphs…) but with effective information: how to reach out to us, where to find us and who are we. 
Even though the vast majority of end users are prospective pets’ owners looking for a practitioner in his/her geographical area, the challenge was to have a website that could also be useful for other users such as: persons in need of emergency services for their pets, pharmaceutical companies, practitioners looking for a collaboration, associations… <br><br>
Also the specificity of this clinic is that it provides Emergency Services. That is the reason why the content needed to be focused on “how to reach out to us” – through phone still remains the most effective way to reach out to the clinic in case of Emergency – and where the clinic is located (Embedded Google Maps). <br><br>
For users that are not in a distressed situation, the website should also address their needs, that is why all the services provided are presented, as well as the information about the education and the experience of the Doctor are provided (practitioner looking for a collaboration for instance). For users who are looking for a practitioner to follow-up their animals on a regular basis, they also have the possibility to book appointment online and/or contact the clinic using the contact form at the end.

<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In terms of general structure of my project I received inspiration mostly from the Sample Project (Grade 5) – Portfolio of Hayley Schaffer. </li>
  <li> Regarding the background positioning, I used the recommendations provided in this link: <a target="_blank" href="https://css-tricks.com/perfect-full-page-background-image/">https://css-tricks.com/perfect-full-page-background-image/</a>. </li>
  <li>The implementation of my carousel was done thanks to the tutorial provided by W3 Schools: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_carousel.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_carousel.asp</a>. </li>
  <li> In terms of general layout I received inspiration mostly from this website – especially the use of the classy blue font-color : <a target="_blank" href="http://athospartners.com">http://athospartners.com</a>.</li>
  <li>In terms of benchmark I also researched websites of clinics located in France (and specialized in Emergency Services). I was therefore able to structure my content after studying the following websites:
    <ul>
   <li> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.urgences-veterinaires-delta-06.fr/ ">http://www.urgences-veterinaires-delta-06.fr/</a></li>
   <li> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fregis.com">https://www.fregis.com</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For the “Doctor” section, I built the timeline (without almost any modifications as it rendered pretty well on my section) by using the code implemented during the Mini Project (building a CV website) at the end of the User Centric module. </li>
  <li>To embed the google maps in the “about us” section I used the code generated in the Embed Google Maps generator: https://embedgooglemaps.com/en/. I added minor modifications in terms of position so that it rendered better on my website. </li>
</ul>
